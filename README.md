# NFC-Card-Game

Use the Arduino coding language to construct a physical board game that uses NFC cards to implement features that would otherwise be impossible (such as probabilities that would be impractical to do with dice). I have an Arduino microcontroller, NFC module, and other Arduino accessories (although they are technically off brands, Arduino products are open source so they are the same thing with a different logo). The details of the game will be decided on by the group.
I will also be using this opportunity to learn Arduino code as I am in computer Engineering and it is closer to my major than pure comp sci.
